Because of unexpected urgent projects at work this week, 
I did not have time to work on the Level 2 portion of the assignment.

Level 1 was fairly straight forward once I understood the Activities
for JavaScript this past week.

My code is contained in the file app.js.

For making the data table visible on the htms site, I used:
// Code taken from Activity 14-3.03-Evr_D3_Table 

For having the filter and button make visible the filtered date, I used:
// Code taken from Activity 14-3.09-Par_Form_Filter 

Note, over Christmas break I plan on working on the Level 2 portion.

I did not have as many github commits because the assignment was fairly
straight forward.
